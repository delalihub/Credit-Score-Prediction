# Predicting credit Score using Machine Learning.

In this project, I used machine learning algorithms to predict credit scores for a given set of borrowers. I explored various techniques to preprocess and clean the data, train and improve the model. The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The primary goal of this project is to build an accurate credit score prediction model that can assist lenders in making informed decisions about extending credit to borrowers. By accurately predicting credit scores, we can help lenders reduce the risk of default and minimize losses while ensuring that deserving borrowers receive the credit they need.

This project will be of interest to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning in finance and the practical applications of data science in the lending industry

## Columns:
 From the original dataset that came with 28 columns, I selected 15 columns whose correlation to my target column was relevant for for my project. The columns used in the project are:

- Customer_ID: This column represents a unique identification of clients of the the bank
- Occupation: This refers to the profession of the loan clients. 
- Monthly_Inhand_Salary: This represents the profession of the clients.
- Num_Bank_Accounts: This represents the count of accounts held by the loan client.
- Num_Credit_Card: The column shows the number of credit cards the client holds.
- Interest_Rate: This shows the interest rate on the credit facility.
- Num_of_Loan: This column represents the the number of different loans running in the name of the client.
- Delay_from_due_date: The column shows the number of days it takes the client on average to pay his monthly loan repayment obligation after due date.
- Outstanding_Debt: The column represents client loan balance.
- Age_category : The column shows the age category the client belongs.
- Credit_Score : The column represents the credit rating of the client and doubles as the target column of the project.
